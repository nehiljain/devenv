## Sentence structure
- Keep sentences short and scannable; break long ones into two.
- Express one idea per sentence; remove filler and redundancy.
- Put the subject first and the verb early; avoid nested clauses.
- Prefer simple present tense and concrete verbs over nominalizations.
- Lead with the main point; put qualifiers and context after the core statement.

## Voice and tone
- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing—say what something _is_ rather than what it _isn't_.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and evidence
- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

### Specificity replacements (vague → concrete)
- "Recently" → "Last Tuesday" or "3 weeks ago"
- "Many users" → "347 users" or "60% of teams"
- "Significant improvement" → "41% faster" or "↓180ms latency"
- "Large scale" → "15M requests/day" or "2.3TB/hour"
- "Fast" → "sub-200ms p95" or "3x faster than X"
- "Our team" → "3 engineers over 2 weeks"
- "Better performance" → "p99 latency dropped from 850ms to 320ms"
- "Improved reliability" → "uptime went from 99.2% to 99.95%"

## Title creation
- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click.
- Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data (use wisely, avoid clickbait).
- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.

## Avoid LLM patterns
- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.
- Avoid starting responses with "Great question!", "You're right!", or "Let me help you."
- Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into..."
- Skip cliché intros like "In today's fast-paced digital world" or "In the ever-evolving landscape of."
- Avoid phrases like "it's not just [x], it's [y]."
- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with."
- Don't use high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."
- Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers.
- Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally," or "Moreover."
- Replace "In conclusion" with direct statements.
- Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real.
- Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly... Secondly..."
- Remove Unicode artifacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes ("), em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Avoid title-case headings; prefer sentence casing.
- Use `'` instead of `′`.
- Delete empty citation placeholders like "[1]" with no actual source.

## Punctuation and formatting
- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And"—but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.
