## 🔄 How Rules Interact

Rules are applied in layers:
1. **`fundamentals.mdc`** (always) → Base writing quality
2. **`social-writing-core.mdc`** (always) → Social media structure
3. **`hook-guard.mdc`** (always) → Opening line enforcement
4. **`cta-guide.mdc`** (always) → Call-to-action enforcement ⭐ NEW
5. **`style-checker.mdc`** (always) → Human voice enforcement
6. **`linkedin-hashtags-links.mdc`** (conditional) → LinkedIn/X hashtags & links
7. **`build-in-public.mdc`** (conditional) → Milestone-specific

## 🚀 How Cursor Loads These

Cursor automatically applies rules based on:
- **`alwaysApply: true`** → Applied to all files matching globs
- **`globs: ["**/*.md"]`** → File pattern matching
- **File naming** → Triggers conditional rules

When you write, these rules:
- Guide AI suggestions and completions
- Enforce structure and style
- Catch banned words/phrases
- Suggest concrete replacements
- Enforce ONE CTA per post
- Limit hashtags (1-3 LinkedIn, 0-2 X)

## 💡 Usage Tips

### File Naming for Conditional Rules
- `linkedin-post-draft.md` → triggers `linkedin-hashtags-links.mdc`
- `milestone-update-week-4.md` → triggers `build-in-public.mdc`
- `build-update.md` → triggers `build-in-public.mdc`
- Any `.md` file → triggers fundamentals, social-core, hook-guard, style-checker

### Workflow
1. **Start writing** → Cursor enforces hooks, structure, voice
2. **Check for banned words** → Style-checker flags them
3. **Add specifics** → Numbers, tools, metrics (style-checker + fundamentals)
4. **Add ONE CTA** → Tied to your promise (cta-guide)
5. **Platform formatting** → LinkedIn/X structure (social-writing-core)
6. **Add hashtags** → 1-3 max (LinkedIn), 0-2 (X)
7. **Final pass** → Use checklists in each rule

### Override When Needed
- Rules are guidelines, not blockers
- Cursor respects explicit instructions
- You can deviate when you have good reason

## 🎓 Learning from the Rules

Each rule file includes:
- ✅ Good examples
- ❌ Bad examples  
- 📝 Templates you can copy
- 🔍 Checklists for verification
- 📊 Before/after comparisons

**Pro tip**: Read through each `.mdc` file once to internalize patterns.

## 🔗 Based On

### Core sources:
- **[jfilatow/cursor-writing](https://github.com/jfilatow/cursor-writing)** (fundamentals.mdc foundation)
- **Justin Welsh's LinkedIn system** (160M+ impressions documented)
- **HubSpot hook analysis** (885 comments case study)
- **Typefully/Hypefury/Ship 30** (thread templates)

## 📝 Customization

To adapt for your needs:

### Add industry-specific terms
Edit `style-checker.mdc` or `fundamentals.mdc`:
```md
# Your Industry Banned Words
- `your-jargon-term` → "plain English"
```

### Adjust hook categories
Edit `hook-guard.mdc` to add your tested hooks:
```md
## 7. Your Hook Type
Description and formula

**Examples:**
- Your example 1
- Your example 2
```

### Change hashtag recommendations
Edit `linkedin-hashtags-links.mdc`:
```md
**For your niche:**
```
#YourTag1 #YourTag2 #YourTag3
```
```

### Add platform-specific rules
Create `twitter-specific.mdc` or `blog-writing.mdc` with:
```md
---
description: Your new rule
alwaysApply: false
globs: ["**/*your-pattern*.md"]
---
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Verify rules are working:

1. **Create test file**: `test-linkedin-post.md`
2. **Start with weak hook**: "I want to share some thoughts..."
   - Cursor should flag: Hook too weak, banned phrase
3. **Try banned word**: "leverage" or "game-changing"
   - Cursor should suggest: "use" or specific alternative
4. **Write vague claim**: "We improved performance"
   - Cursor should prompt: For specific metrics
5. **Add multiple CTAs**: "What do you think? Also share and follow!"
   - Cursor should flag: Multiple actions (should be ONE only)
6. **Add 5+ hashtags**: 
   - Cursor should flag: Too many (use 1-3 max)

If Cursor doesn't flag these, check:
- Rules are in `.cursor/rules/writing/` folder
- File extensions match globs (`.md`, `.txt`, `.mdx`)
- Restart Cursor to reload rules

## 📊 Metrics to Track

After using these rules for 2-4 weeks:
- **Engagement rate**: Comments/reactions per post
- **Reach**: Impressions per post
- **Click-through**: If you're sharing links
- **Time to write**: Should decrease as patterns internalize
- **Feedback quality**: Are comments more substantive?

## 🆘 Common Issues

**"Rules feel too restrictive"**  
→ They're maximalist by design. Override when you have specific reasons.

**"Too many banned words"**  
→ Start with fundamentals.mdc only, add others gradually.

**"Cursor not suggesting rule-aligned content"**  
→ Be explicit: "Write this following the hook-guard rules"

**"Need different rules for different clients"**  
→ Create client-specific folders: `.cursor/rules/client-a/writing/`

## 🔄 Keeping Rules Updated

These rules capture 2024-2025 best practices. To stay current:
- Test new hooks and track engagement
- Update `linkedin-hashtags-links.mdc` as algorithm changes
- Add newly-discovered banned phrases to `style-checker.mdc`
- Rotate in new examples that work for your audience

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Read one rule file per day** to internalize patterns
2. **Start with fundamentals + style-checker** (core voice)
3. **Add social-writing-core + hook-guard** (structure + hooks)
4. **Layer in platform-specific rules** as needed
5. **Track your metrics** before and after using rules
6. **Customize** based on what works for your audience

**Pro tip**: Commit these rules to version control so your whole team writes with the same voice and structure.
