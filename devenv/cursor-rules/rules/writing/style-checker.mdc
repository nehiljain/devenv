# AI-Sounding Patterns to Avoid
- Starting with "Great question!", "Let me share", "Let's dive into"
- Excessive transition words: "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "However,"
- Lists where every item starts with the same verb or structure
- Overly formal transitions: "In light of this," "With that being said"
- Corporate jargon stacks: "leverage robust synergies to facilitate seamless integration"
- Perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or "Firstly... Secondly... Thirdly..."
- Hedging stacks: "may potentially," "might possibly," "it's important to note that"
- Em dashes (—) everywhere → use semicolons, commas, or break into sentences
- High-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," "To summarize"
- Ending with "Hope this helps!" or "Let me know if you have questions!"

# Human-Sounding Rules
## Voice
- Use contractions freely: don't, won't, can't, I'll, you're
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee
- One clear idea per sentence; break complex thoughts into multiple sentences
- Vary sentence length: mix 3-word punches with longer explanatory sentences
- Use "I" and "we" freely—show a real person is writing
- Be confident and direct; avoid softening with "I think," "maybe," "could"

## Sentence structure
- Put subject first, verb early; avoid nested clauses
- Lead with the main point; add context after
- Express one idea per sentence
- Active voice over passive: "We shipped X" not "X was shipped"
- Simple present tense when possible

## Tone
- Positive phrasing: say what something IS, not what it ISN'T
- Direct statements over hedged opinions
- Skip filler intros and outros
- Start sentences with "But" or "And" when it flows naturally (don't overuse)

# Specificity Checks
Replace every vague phrase with concrete details:

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Concrete |
|---------|-----------|
| "Recently" | "Last Tuesday" or "3 weeks ago" |
| "Many users" | "347 users" or "60% of teams" |
| "Significant improvement" | "41% faster" or "↓180ms" |
| "Large scale" | "15M requests/day" or "2.3TB/hour" |
| "Fast" | "sub-200ms p95" or "3x faster than X" |
| "Our team" | "3 engineers over 2 weeks" |
| "Better performance" | "p99 latency: 850ms → 320ms" |
| "Lots of customers" | "180+ companies" or "12K developers" |
| "Expensive" | "$45K/month" or "3x our budget" |
| "Complex system" | "9 microservices, 4 databases" |
| "Long time" | "6 months" or "18 sprints" |

# Concreteness Test
For every claim, ask: **"Can I picture this or measure it?"**

❌ **Vague examples:**
- "We optimized the system"
- "Users loved the new feature"
- "Performance improved significantly"
- "The team worked hard"
- "It's really fast now"

✅ **Concrete examples:**
- "We moved auth checks to edge → latency ↓180ms"
- "NPS went from 42 to 67 in 8 weeks"
- "p95 response time dropped from 1.2s to 340ms"
- "3 engineers shipped it in 11 days"
- "Page load: 4.8s → 1.1s (77% faster)"

# Examples of Good vs. Bad
## Bad (generic, vague, AI-ish):
```
In today's rapidly evolving landscape, we're excited to announce 
that we've leveraged cutting-edge technology to revolutionize the 
way teams collaborate. Our innovative solution seamlessly integrates 
with your existing workflow, unlocking unprecedented productivity gains.

Furthermore, our robust architecture ensures blazing-fast performance 
at scale. We obsess over the developer experience, and we can't wait 
to see what you'll build with this game-changing platform.
```

## Good (specific, concrete, human):
```
We shipped real-time collaboration.

3 people can now edit the same doc simultaneously. Conflicts resolve 
automatically—no more "v2_final_FINAL.docx" disasters.

Early numbers: sync latency under 100ms (p95), works offline, handles 
50+ concurrent editors per doc.

Built it in 6 weeks with 2 engineers. Uses CRDTs + WebSocket fallback.
