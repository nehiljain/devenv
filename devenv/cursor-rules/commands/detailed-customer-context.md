# Detailed Customer Context

## Overview
Create a structured customer brief by gathering the latest context for a company and outputting a filled Markdown template for downstream sharing.

## Inputs
- `query`: Company name or identifier. If missing, ask the user to provide the company.


## Steps
1. **Capture company**
   - Use the provided `query`.
   - If empty, request the company name from the user before continuing.
2. **Gather context**
   - Use available knowledge, notes linked to `10-Projects`, and meeting logs in `_Meetings` folder to summarize use cases, people, and compute stack for the company.
   - Identify the business problem each use case addresses and capture measurable or directional impact (revenue, efficiency, risk mitigation, etc.).
   - Highlight where information is unknown or needs follow-up.
3. **Produce Markdown**
   - Populate every section in the output template.
   - Include concrete details when known and leave TODOs for gaps.
   - Return the completed Markdown document as the command output.

## Output
- Markdown-formatted customer context document based on the template below.

## Output Template

# Use Cases

- Add additional use cases as separate bullet groups following the same structure.

# Key People & Teams

- Additional contacts as needed.

# Compute Strategy
